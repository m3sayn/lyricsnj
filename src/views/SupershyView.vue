        [Chorus: Danielle, Hyein, Hanni, Haerin]
        I'm super shy, super shy
        But wait a minute while I make you mine, make you mine
        떨리는 지금도, you're on my mind all the time
        I wanna tell you but I'm super shy, super shy
        I'm super shy, super shy
        But wait a minute while I make you mine, make you mine
        떨리는 지금도, you're on my mind all the time
        I wanna tell you but I'm super shy, super shy

        [Verse 1: Hyein, Minji]
        And I wanna go out with you
        Where you wanna go? (Huh?)
        Find a lil spot, just sit and talk
        Looking pretty, follow me
        우리 둘이 나란히
        보이지? (봐)
        내 눈이 (Heh)
        갑자기, 빛나지
        When you say I'm your dream

        [Verse 2: Minji, Hanni]
        나 원래 말도 잘하고 그런데 왜 이런지
        I don't like that
        Something odd about you
        Yeah, you're special and you know it
        You're the top, babe
